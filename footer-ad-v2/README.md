# Samples Sticky Footer Ad Implementation

The footer ad is a format that is only visible after a fill has
been confirmed for the slot via googletag.

The footerAd can be used for Mobile and Desktop viewports. All the designs have a close button which will swipe the adSlot down
with a transition animation. Clicking the close button will eventually remove the dom container.
