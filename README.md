# Footer Ads sample implementations

Highfivve's ad stack offers two possibilities for sticky footer ads:

- a [mobile sticky ad](mobile-sticky/index.html),
- a [sticky desktop footer ad](footer-ad/index.html).
- a [sticky header ad](header-sticky/index.html).
- and a [sticky footer ad v2](footer-ad-v2/index.html).

As there's some code that needs to be included in the publisher's website, this repository offers a sample
implementation for each of these formats.

Find the rendered output to test and try for yourself here: https://highfivve.github.io/footer-ads/.

Alternatively, you can check out the repo and fiddle for yourself using a local web server. All files are
self-contained, no build or dependencies necessary.
